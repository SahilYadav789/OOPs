It behaves just like a regular function but happens to live inside a class, mostly for logical grouping. For example, if you put an add(a, b) method inside a Math class and mark it as a static method, it won't know anything about the class itself,  it just performs addition.\n",

For instance, if you have a Person class with a species variable, a class method can change the species for all objects of that class at once. Class methods are also very handy when you want alternative ways to create objects, which is why they're often used as factory methods."
